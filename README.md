Hello guys! Here is UserNotFound. I'm new, really newww, so if my code have any bugs, you can post a issue.
My favorite code language is Kotlin, I think Kotlin is so humanity. :)
I'm not a good English speaker (my English is so bad!), so I will use translator. ğŸ¤–
I'm a Lazy ğŸ¦¥ person, so my project will NOT have too many updates. (maybe not ğŸ¤”)
Oh btw, i'm Chinese so you can speak Chinese to me. ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³

Here is some of my statuses
